# 1.0.10 (2019-04-16)

- Added a `showFlyout` method to allow developers to display supplementary information in a flyout panel.

# 1.0.9 (2019-03-01)

- Added a `showToast` method to allow developers to show a toast with a provided message and toast style.

# 1.0.8 (2019-02-13)

- To remove confusion and clarify the intent, we've added a new method named `getUserIdentityToken`.  This method is
used to obtain a user identity token from the host application and replaces the `getAuthToken` method (which is still
functional but marked as deprecated).

- Added tile config options to allow developers to provide additional metadata, such as tile summary details and whether
to show a tile's help or settings icons.

- Added `helpClick` and `settingsClick` callbacks to allow developers to take action when the tile help and settings
icons (respectfully) are clicked.

# 1.0.7 (2019-02-01)

- Added a `buttonClick` callback for Button Add-ins to allow developers to take action when buttons are clicked.

- Added button config options to support Button Add-ins. This allows developers to provide `style` metadata -
essentially, the button's intent as it relates to CRUD operations (add, edit, delete). We will add more "styles" as
requested.
